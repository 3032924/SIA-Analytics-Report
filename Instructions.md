# Predictive Analytics Report Instructions

You have been provided with a large AFL dataset `data_forStudents.csv` and will be required to train a model to predict the winner of AFL matches based on the given feature variables a description of the features and response can be found in the `Variable-Descriptions.md` file of this repo.

You will use Rmarkdown to document and generate a knit'd report (PDF or compiled HTML) of your analyses and results. The report should be no longer than 10 pages, and should thoroughly and effectively describe the following:

1. Overview and aim of the project
2. Reading in and tidying the data
3. Data splitting and pre-processing
4. Exploratory data analysis and feature selection
5. Model training and cross-validation
6. Model testing
7. Summary
8. References (you can choose which referencing style to use) 
 

(Refer to the marking rubric for more information about what is required for each section).

In addition to describing the steps taken throughout the analysis, the report should also provide a logical justification for the methods and processes used, correct interpretation of the output and results, and limitations of the methods used. Relevant figures and/or tables can be used in the report to complement the information presented in text and code. 

After you have trained, tested and validated your model, you will be applying your model to the new match data, (found in the `newData.csv` file from this repo) to complete Part B of this assignment.
